Battery care aims to extend the lifespan of the battery by reducing wear
and capacity loss resulting from ongoing operation. This can be achieved by:

1. Limiting the maximum charge level to below 100% (stop charge threshold)
2. Preventing the charging process from continuing as soon as the charger
   is connected after a short discharge (start charge threshold)
3. Recalibration helps keep the charge level readings and battery
   runtime estimates accurate by setting new "full charge" and "full discharge"
   anchors in the battery controller.

Battery care does *not* involve additional power saving.
