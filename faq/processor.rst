Sluggish performance with kernel 5.7 (and newer)
-------------------------------------------------
Symptoms: you have configured the `powersave` scaling governor for `intel_pstate`: ::

    CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC=powersave
    CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT=powersave

and :command:`tlp-stat -p` displays ::

    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver    = intel_cpufreq
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor  = powersave
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors = conservative ondemand userspace powersave performance schedutil

Cause: starting with kernel 5.7, the `intel_pstate` scaling driver selects
"passive mode" aka `intel_cpufreq` for CPUs that do not support hardware-managed
P-states (HWP), i.e. Intel Core i 5th gen. or older. The governor
`powersave` provided by `intel_cpufreq` works differently than the one provided
by `intel_pstate` and produces the sluggish behaviour.

Solution: use the default governor â€“ should be `schedutil` - by commenting
above configuration lines or configure it explictly: ::

    CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC=schedutil
    CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT=schedutil

For details refer to :ref:`set-cpu-scaling-governor`.

CPU_BOOST_ON_BAT/AC=0 decreases scaling_max_freq
------------------------------------------------
Affected hardware: ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen9

Symptom: :command:`tlp-stat -p` shows `scaling_max_freq` way below the nominal
frequency of the CPU: ::

    +++ Processor
    CPU model      = 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz

    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver    = intel_pstate
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor  = powersave
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq  =  1200000 [kHz]

Probable cause: `intel_pstate` driver or UEFI firmware bug.

Workaround: either do not disable turbo boost or configure :ref:`set-platform-profile`
(see `Issue #570 <https://github.com/linrunner/TLP/issues/570>`_ for details).

Frequency scaling settings do not get applied
---------------------------------------------
Symptom: :command:`tlp-stat -p` shows values that do not reflect configuration.

There are several possible causes:

.. rubric:: Invalid frequency settings

Solution: :command:`tlp-stat -p` tells the possible frequencies for your CPU.
Example: ::

    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies = 2400000 1600000 800000 [kHz]

.. rubric:: No `ondemand` governor with `intel_pstate`

Symptom: :command:`tlp-stat -p` displays ::

    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver = intel_pstate
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor = powersave

Works as designed: since kernel 3.9 the new scaling driver `intel_pstate` is
available and enabled by default on Intel Sandy Bridge (or newer) hardware.
`intel_pstate` supports the governors `powersave` (recommended default) and
`performance` only, `ondemand` is not available.

AMD CPU with `amd-pstate-epp` driver doesn't switch EPP
-------------------------------------------------------
Solution: AMD EPP requires at least TLP version 1.6.


.. _faq-cpu-gov-locks-epp:

Governor `performance` also locks EPP to `performance`
------------------------------------------------------
Symptom: `energy_performance_preference` is set to `performance` regardless of
`CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_AC/BAT`. Happens with `amd_pstate` and `intel_pstate`
in active mode. :command:`tlp-stat -p` gives ::

    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver    = amd-pstate-epp | intel_pstate
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor  = performance
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference = performance [EPP]

Works as designed: full throttle and brake at the same time isn't permitted
by the kernel driver. Makes sense, doesn't it?

`tlp-stat -p` shows "x86_energy_perf_policy: program for your kernel not installed."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Depending on the distribution your mileage may vary:

* **Ubuntu**: install the metapackage `linux-tools-generic` or `linux-tools-generic-lts-*`
  for HWE stack kernels, no package is available for mainline kernels.
* **Debian**: install the package `linux-cpupower`.
* **Arch**: install the package `x86_energy_perf_policy`.
* **Fedora**: install the package `kernel-tools`.
