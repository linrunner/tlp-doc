PLATFORM_PROFILE_ON_AC/BAT
--------------------------
::

    PLATFORM_PROFILE_ON_AC=performance
    PLATFORM_PROFILE_ON_BAT=low-power

Select the platform profile to control system operating characteristics around
power/performance levels, thermal and fan speed. Possible values in order of
increasing power saving are:

* performance
* balanced
* low-power

.. note::

    Check the output of :command:`tlp-stat -p` to determine availability on your
    hardware and additional profiles such as `balanced-performance`, `quiet`, `cool`.

MEM_SLEEP_ON_AC/BAT
-------------------
*Version 1.6 and newer*

::

    MEM_SLEEP_ON_AC=s2idle
    MEM_SLEEP_ON_BAT=deep

Select the system suspend mode:

 * s2idle - Idle standby, a pure software, light-weight, system sleep state
 * deep - Suspend to RAM, the whole system is put into a low-power state,
   except for memory, usually resulting in higher savings than s2idle

.. caution::

    Changing suspend mode may lead to system instability and even
    data loss. As for the availability of different modes on your system,
    check the output of tlp-stat -s. If unsure, stick with the system default
    by not enabling this.
