CPU_DRIVER_OPMODE_ON_AC/BAT
---------------------------
*Version 1.6 and newer*

::

    CPU_DRIVER_OPMODE_ON_AC=active
    CPU_DRIVER_OPMODE_ON_BAT=active

Selects a CPU scaling driver operation mode. Configuration depends on the
active driver:

.. rubric:: amd-pstate

AMD Zen 2 or newer CPUs provide:

* active - requires kernel 6.3 or newer, changes driver name to `amd-pstate-epp`
* passive
* guided - requires kernel 6.4 or newer

Since AMD's kernel documentation is hard to penetrate, here is an attempt
to outline the individual modes (without guarantee):

* In **active** mode, the processor selects the operating frequencies
  autonomously within the limits imposed by the hardware, including turbo boost.
  The `powersave` governor can also lead to max frequency.
  Configuring the min and max frequency (as shown below) is *not* supported.
* With **guided** mode, you may configure the min and max frequency (see below),
  and the processor will choose the operating frequency itself in the specified
  range. Guided is basically active mode with frequency range enforced.
* In **passive** mode, in contrast to guided, the governor dictates the
  frequencies as configured.


.. note::

    * For kernels older than 6.5 `amd-pstate` must be activated via a kernel
      boot option; see the driver documentation linked at the bottom.
    * It should be kept in mind that not all laptop BIOSes allow the activation
      despite a suitable CPU. Please do *not* open TLP issues for this.
    * Some users have observed limited frequency or P-state ranges after
      switching modes. These are hardware issues or kernel issues, so please
      do *not* open a TLP issue for them.

.. rubric:: intel_pstate

Intel Core i 2nd gen. ("Sandy Bridge") or newer Intel CPUs provide these modes:

* active
* passive

Starting with kernel 5.7, the `intel_pstate` driver selects passive mode
aka `intel_cpufreq` for CPUs that do not support hardware-managed P-states
(HWP), i.e. Intel Core i 5th gen. or older.

.. rubric:: acpi-cpufreq

Older AMD/Intel CPUs and other vendors do not support change of
driver mode.


.. _set-cpu-scaling-governor:

CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC/BAT
------------------------------
::

    CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC=powersave
    CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT=powersave

Selects the CPU scaling governor for automatic frequency scaling. Configuration
depends on the active driver:

.. rubric:: amd-pstate | intel_pstate in active mode

* performance
* powersave – default

.. rubric:: amd-state in passive or guided mode
            | intel_pstate in passive mode
            | acpi-cpufreq

* conservative
* ondemand – default for most distributions
* userspace
* powersave
* performance
* schedutil – default for newer kernels and the `amd-pstate`/`intel_pstate`
  drivers in passive mode

.. note::

    * Refer to the output of :command:`tlp-stat -p` to determine the active
      scaling driver and available governors.
    * Keep in mind that modularized kernels may not reveal all available
      governors in the :command:`tlp-stat -p` output after boot.
      In this case, configure the desired governor anyway and, after
      :command:`tlp start`, check the output of :command:`tlp-stat -p` again
      (requires version 1.6).

.. important::

    Default governors listed above are power efficient for almost all workloads,
    therefore kernel devs and most distributions have chosen them as such.
    So *before* changing the scaling governor please do your research about the
    advantages and disadvantages of the others (refer to the links at the bottom
    of this page).

CPU_SCALING_MIN/MAX_FREQ_ON_AC/BAT
----------------------------------
::

    CPU_SCALING_MIN_FREQ_ON_AC=0
    CPU_SCALING_MAX_FREQ_ON_AC=9999999
    CPU_SCALING_MIN_FREQ_ON_BAT=0
    CPU_SCALING_MAX_FREQ_ON_BAT=9999999

Set the min/max frequency available for the scaling governor. Possible values
depend on your CPU. For available frequencies consult the output of
:command:`tlp-stat -p`.

Hints:

* Do not use this setting with the `intel_pstate` driver in active mode,
  use :ref:`set-cpu-min-max-perf` instead
* Min/max frequencies must always be specified for both modes i.e. `AC` and `BAT`
* To enable processor defaults comment all four settings and reboot
* Lowering the max frequency on battery power may not conserve power;
  best results are to be expected from the above mentioned default governors
  without frequency limits


.. _set-cpu-energy-perf-policy:

CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_AC/BAT
--------------------------------

::

    CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_AC=balance_performance
    CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_BAT=balance_power

Set CPU energy/performance policies (in order of
increasing power saving):

* performance
* balance_performance
* default
* balance_power
* power

Default when unconfigured: balance_performance (AC), balance_power (BAT)

Requirements:

.. rubric:: AMD

*Version 1.6 and newer*

* AMD Zen 2 or newer CPU with kernel 6.3 and `amd-pstate` driver in active mode

.. rubric:: Intel

* **HWP.EPP** (hardware-managed P-states): Intel Core i 6th gen. ("Skylake")
  or newer CPU with kernel 4.10 and `intel_pstate` driver in active mode
* **EPB**: Intel Core i 2nd gen. (“Sandy Bridge”) or newer CPU with kernel 5.2
  and `intel_pstate` driver
* Note that HWP.EPP and EPB are mutually exclusive. When EPP is available,
  Intel CPUs will not honor EPB. Only the matching feature will be applied
  by TLP and shown by :command:`tlp-stat -p`.


.. _set-cpu-min-max-perf:

CPU_MIN/MAX_PERF_ON_AC/BAT
--------------------------
::

    CPU_MIN_PERF_ON_AC=0
    CPU_MAX_PERF_ON_AC=100
    CPU_MIN_PERF_ON_BAT=0
    CPU_MAX_PERF_ON_BAT=30

Define the min/max P-state for Intel CPUs. Values are stated as a
percentage (0..100%) of the total available processor performance.

Hints:

* Requires Intel Core i 2nd gen. ("Sandy Bridge") or newer CPU with
  `intel_pstate` or `intel_cpufreq` scaling driver
* The driver imposes a limit > 0 on the min P-state, see `min_perf_pct` in the
  output of :command:`tlp-stat -p`
* This setting is intended to limit the power dissipation of the CPU


.. _set-cpu-boost:

CPU_BOOST_ON_AC/BAT
-------------------
::

    CPU_BOOST_ON_AC=1
    CPU_BOOST_ON_BAT=0

Configure CPU "turbo boost" (Intel) or "core performance boost" aka "turbo core" (AMD):

* 0 - disable
* 1 - allow

.. note::

    * A value of 1 does not activate boosting, it just allows it
    * For use with the `amd-pstate` driver, at least kernel 6.11 is required


CPU_HWP_DYN_BOOST_ON_AC/BAT
---------------------------
::

    CPU_HWP_DYN_BOOST_ON_AC=1
    CPU_HWP_DYN_BOOST_ON_BAT=0


Configure the Intel CPU HWP dynamic boost feature:

* 0 - disable
* 1 - enable

Requires: Intel Core i 6th gen. ("Skylake") or newer CPU with `intel_pstate`
scaling driver in `active` mode
