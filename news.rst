03.09.2023 - Optimizing Guide
=============================
TLPâ€™s default settings should save as much energy on battery power as possible,
but in reality there are limits to what can be done based on the default settings.
The brand new :doc:`/support/optimizing` explores possibilities to tune
TLP individually and achieve even better battery runtime or performance
on AC respectively.

Enjoy and save!

17.02.2022 - How can I use Battery Care with my Laptop?
=======================================================
TLP includes battery charge thresholds for Lenovo (and IBM) ThinkPads from the
very beginning. That remained so for a long time. Recently - with version 1.4 and 1.5 -
numerous vendors have been added: ASUS, Huawei, LG, Lenovo (non-ThinkPad series),
Samsung and Sony.

The charge control options of the newly supported hardware vary greatly depending
on the vendor (or brand). The new article :doc:`/settings/bc-vendors` explains
configuration and prerequisites in detail.

Enjoy :-)


07.01.2022 - TLP 1.5 released
=============================
Happy New Year!

The final release of TLP 1.5 is out. New features are:

* Charge threshold support for Sony laptops
* Use the new kernel interface for recalibration of ThinkPad
  batteries (new sysfs node *charge_behaviour*), which will make the external
  kernel module *acpi_call* obsolete; *expected to appear with kernel 5.17*
* Support for switching NFC devices (new command :command:`nfc on|off`)

Check the `release notes <https://github.com/linrunner/TLP/releases>`_
and the complete `changelog <https://github.com/linrunner/TLP/blob/main/changelog>`_
