Fedora
======

.. important::

   Good news! The issues with SELinux have been fixed in Fedora 40,
   so you can enjoy full TLP functionality again.

.. rubric:: Scope:

* Officially supported Fedora releases

.. note::

    Execute the commands below in a root shell or with with a preceding :command:`sudo`.

Package Installation
--------------------
TLP packages are available from the official Fedora repositories:

* **tlp** *(Updates)* – Power saving
* **tlp-rdw** *(Updates)* – optional – :doc:`/settings/rdw`

Hint: packages for RHEL/CentOS are available from the EPEL repositories.

Install the packages either with your favorite package manager or the command: ::

   dnf install tlp tlp-rdw

Uninstall the conflicting packages: 

* Fedora version 40 and below ::

   dnf remove power-profiles-daemon

* Fedora version 41 and newer ::

   dnf remove tuned tuned-ppd

.. seealso::

    FAQ: :doc:`/faq/ppd`

Service Units
-------------
To complete the installation you must enable TLP's service: ::

   systemctl enable tlp.service

You should also mask the following services to avoid conflicts and assure proper
operation of TLP's :doc:`/settings/radio` options: ::

   systemctl mask systemd-rfkill.service systemd-rfkill.socket

Legacy ThinkPads only: External Kernel Module for Battery Care
--------------------------------------------------------------
.. important::

    Fedora 40 was released with Linux kernel 6.8. In combination with TLP 1.5
    or newer it offers full battery care support (i.e. charge thresholds and
    recalibration) for ThinkPads from model year 2011 onwards.

    **An external kernel module (also referred to as "out-of-tree" module)
    is not required in this case, and the following steps are not necessary.
    However, if your model is from 2011 or older, read on.**

Only if the bottom of the output of :command:`tlp-stat -b`, section 'Recommendations',
shows the line

.. code-block:: none

    Install tp-smapi kernel modules for ThinkPad battery thresholds and recalibration

then install the required packages. They are not available from the official Fedora repositories.
Instead you need to add the `RPM Fusion` and `ThinkPad Extras` repositories: ::

   dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
   dnf install https://repo.linrunner.de/fedora/tlp/repos/releases/tlp-release.fc$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

.. note::

    Above steps are only needed on a new installation of Fedora *but not* after release
    upgrades.

Required packages:

* **kernel-devel** *(Fedora repo)* – Needed to build the kernel module from
  the `akmod` package
* **akmod-tp_smapi** *(ThinkPad Extras repo)* – optional – External kernel
  module source providing battery charge thresholds and recalibration

Install either with your favorite package manager
or the command ::

   dnf install kernel-devel akmod-tp_smapi

New packages are available first in the testing repository: ::

   dnf --enablerepo=tlp-updates-testing install kernel-devel akmod-tp_smapi

.. important::

    * The `akmod-*` package is provided "as is" by a volunteer, it is
      not part of the TLP project
    * Please *do not file issues* if it is not yet available for the
      latest Fedora version, better watch the `tlp-updates-testing` repository
    * In case of difficulties installing, please ask for help in your
      preferred Fedora forum

.. note::

    * The RPM Fusion repo delivers build dependencies for the `akmod-*` packages
    * You must disable Secure Boot to use the ThinkPad specific packages

How to validate the Repository Keys
-----------------------------------
Kernel module packages provided by the ThinkPad Extras repository for Fedora are
signed with a release specific key. Yo may check the fingerprint with the
following procedure.

1. Download the key:

.. code-block:: none

    wget https://repo.linrunner.de/fedora/tlp/repos/RPM-GPG-KEY-tlp-fedora-40-primary

2. Get the fingerprint:

.. code-block:: none

    gpg -n -q --import --import-options import-show RPM-GPG-KEY-tlp-fedora-40-primary

3. Check that the resulting fingerprint matches the fingerprint from the list below.

4. If they match, import the key:

.. code-block:: none

    rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-tlp-fedora-40-primary
