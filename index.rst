    TLP is a feature-rich utility for Linux, **saving laptop battery power**
    without the need to delve deeper into technical details.

    *Version 1.9* introduces **tlp-pd**, which enables easy **profile switching
    with a mouse click** and **replaces power-profiles-daemon**.

    TLP's default settings are already **optimized for battery life** and
    implement Powertop's recommendations out of the box, so you may install
    it and just **sit back and relax**!

    But wait, there's more! TLP is **completely customizable**, which means
    you can get **even more power savings** or meet your exact requirements –
    the possibilities are endless.

    Last but not least, TLP provides a unified approach to **battery charge
    thresholds** on supported laptops.
